# Pacman with map creator
## Overview
The game has two modes: company mode and user map mode, with the same rules.
When a ghost contacts the player, the player dies, losing one life. Each round starts anew from the default position. 
Eating balls or sleeping ghosts increases the player's score. The small balls give 20 points, big balls and sleeping ghosts give 200 points. Eating a big ball makes ghosts move slower, allowing the player to eat them. 
The game ends when the player runs out of lives. 
Winning occurs when the player eats all the balls on the map.
